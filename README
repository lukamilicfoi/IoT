HOW TO USE:
- currently only compiling and running on Linux is supported
- currently only installing dependencies on ArchLinux is supported unless you know analogue packages
- dependencies must be installed before anything else
- dependencies must be uninstalled manually
- to build/clean run build.sh/clean.sh
- to install/uninstall run install.sh/uninstall.sh
- to initialize/deinitialize run initialize.sh/deinitialize.sh
- to start/stop run start.sh/stop.sh
- do not run anything with sudo since sudo will be asked from you when needed
- do not run anything outside of this directory 
- everything is done in the current directory
- installing and uninstalling are actually building & initializing and deinitializing & cleaning
- building is needed to be done only once (unless your change the program code)
- initializing is needed to be done only once (unless you want a fresh database)
- configuration is done on localhost
- logging is done on stdout
